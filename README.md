# ERA1_Session5 Repo

This repo contains the following 3 files to train a MNIST handwritten digit classifier model using the MNIST PyTorch dataset:

- `model.py`
- `utils.py`
- `S5.ipynb`

## Model.py

This file defines a Python class called `NET` that specifies the architecture of the neural network model.

## utils.py

The `utils.py` file includes functions for training and testing the neural network model. It also provides the `train_transforms` and `test_transforms` functions, which are responsible for converting input batches of images into the appropriate format for the model.

## S5.ipynb

This is the main Jupyter Notebook that trains the MNIST digit classifier model using the above two files, along with the PyTorch library functions.
